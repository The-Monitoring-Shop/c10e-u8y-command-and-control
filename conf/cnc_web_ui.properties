# Network
#   tls_enabled      - enable https. Default is false, as it's recomended to use a http reverse proxy to manage TLS.
#   listen_port      - Port on which the cnc_web_ui listens for http(s) connections
#   listen_address   - IP address on which the cnc_web_ui will listen. 
#                      Set this to 0.0.0.0 to listen an all available addresses
tls_enabled=false
listen_port=8090
listen_address=0.0.0.0

# Security
#   tls_cert        - location of TLS certificate to use (ignored if tls_enabled=false)
#   tls_private_key - location of TLS private key tp use (ignored if tls_enabled=false)
#   inactivity_timeout - If we have not heard from a client within this time (in seconds), log them out. 
#                   
#   anon_allow      - Allow Anonymous access. 
#   anon_rbac       - Anonymous permissions (**Yet to be Implemented**)
#   static_allow    - JSON file listing which static objects (e.g. html, css etc) can accessed by clients 
#

# Logging
#   log_location        - Location of log files
#   log_filename        - Filename of log file
#   log_max_size        - Max size of log (in bytes), before it gets rotated
#   log_num_retain      - Number of old logs to retain
#   log_level           - Logging Level - Options are: trace, debug, info, warn, error, fatal. TODO: Make this dynamic

# Misc
#   cases               - JSON file containing use case data
#   dev_mode            - When set to true, requested static objects will be re-loaded from file on every request (as a development aid)
#                         This should almost always be set to false, otherwise it will significantly degrade performance
